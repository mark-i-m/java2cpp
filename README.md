#[WIP] C++ for Java Programmers

This GitBook is for people with familiarity of Java who want to learn C++. In
particular, it highlights the semantic differences between Java and C++.

It remains to be seen how often I work on this book because I am a full-time
student, but feel free to contribute or suggest changes by submitting a PR or
issue on GitHub.

This repo contains the GitBook and code samples.

If you want to work on it yourself, the best starting point is the GitBook
[Getting Started](http://toolchain.gitbook.com/) page. You will need to install
the `gitbook` utility with NPM.

You can view the book [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mark-i-m/c-for-java-prpgrammers/details).
