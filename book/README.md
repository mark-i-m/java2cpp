#[WIP] C++ for Java Programmers

This book is for people with familiarity of Java who want to learn C++. In
particular, it highlights the semantic differences between Java and C++.
It assumes some knowledge of programming, including a vague notion of how
memory is layed out.

It remains to be seen how often I work on this book because I am a full-time
student, but feel free to contribute or suggest changes by submitting a PR or
issue on GitHub.

This is the GitBook. A repo with some code examples is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mark-i-m/java2cpp).

You may want to install `g++`, the GNU C++ compiler or some other C++ compiler
so you can follow along.
