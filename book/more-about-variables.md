# Variables, part 2

At this point, I'm just going to introduce a bunch of key concepts in the C++. These concepts really lend a lot of power to C++, but they can be subtle. Really, the best way to learn this stuff is to play around with lots of examples...

Most of the concepts in the following sub-chapters are basically ways to change the semantics of a variable with respect to memory. This allows programmers to improve the memory safety of their code, avoid some of the problems we previously discussed.

Onward!
